    <h2>Film Composition Showreel</h2>
    <p>I love to compose music for film and television (and hopefully games one day), and here is a short sample of my work. Please get in touch if you would like to discuss an upcoming project, or if you would like to see more examples - levi@levipatel.com</p>
    <p>Special thanks to the talented and generous filmmakers for inviting me to contribute to their beautiful work, and for offering their footage for this showreel.</p>
