      <h1>Recording Studio and Audio Engineering</h1>

      <p>I am a technically minded person (read: nerd) and the engineering side of music and audio appeals to me just as much as the creative side. I'm fortunate to have my own studio to work from, where I record and mix music and film audio.</p>

      <p>Located one hour north of Auckland, New Zealand, the studio was acoustically engineered by Tim Farrant, lovingly built over a summer, and upgraded in early 2021. It's both an intimate yet high quality production room as well as a creative retreat, with the surrounding landscape offering a quiet space to think and write.</p>

      <p>This is where I spend 90% of my time, it's a difficult place to leave. I have also enjoyed working here with talented artists such as This Pale Fire, Gala George (pictured below), Suren Unka, and Jeremy Redmore.</p>

      <p>And what studio is complete without some resident horses?</p>
