      <h1>Recording Studio and Audio Engineering</h1>

      <p>I'm a technically minded person (read: nerd) and the engineering side of music and audio appeals to me just as much as the creative side. I am fortunate to have my own studio to work from, where I engineer my own music, music for other artists, and film audio.</p>

      <p>Located one hour north of central Auckland, New Zealand, the studio is both a practical recording space and a creative retreat. It was acoustically engineered by Tim Farrant, lovingly built over a summer, and upgraded in early 2021. The studio is an intimate yet high quality production room, with the surrounding landscape offering the quiet space to think.</p>

      <h2>Studio Philosophy and Design</h2>

      <!-- <p>Designed to be a creative, comfortable space where you can write in the room together and walk through the trees or beach later</p> -->

      <!-- <p>I believe that the best music is made when people are connected, which is why I always prefer single room studios</p> -->
      
      <!-- <p>Corban Koschak, aka <i>This Pale Fire</i>, aka one of my favourite songwriters, approached me looking to imbue some of my style into the production one of his beautiful songs. What began as one song turned into an opportunity to produce his stunning album <i>Alchemy</i>.</p> -->

      <!-- <p>During the project Corban traveled up most weekends to my <a href="/studio">recording studio</a> north of Auckland, each time with the core of a new song. We would develop and arrange the song together over the weekend, transforming them from solo acoustic songs into what you hear on the album.</p> -->

      <p>Rhian Sheehan has been a huge influence on me since I discovered his music in 2009, and a couple of years ago we finally got to work together in a dream collaboration for me. We traded the spark of an idea back and forth until eventually it grew into <i>Toward the Sun</i>, released on Rhianâ€™s album <a href="https://rhiansheehan.bandcamp.com/album/a-quiet-divide"><i>A Quiet Divide</i></a>.</p>

      <p>Every time I received a new version from him it was filled with beautifully subtle tweaks along with wonderfully surprising changes, and the music moved me more and more as the piece evolved. It was incredible.</p>

      <p>I worked with electronic producer Suren Unka to create our <a href="https://surenunka.bandcamp.com/album/5-8"><i>5/8</i> EP</a>, and here we are performing it live in studio.</p>

      <p>While we both worked together on all elements, Suren focused on the beats and synth sound design, while I worked closely on the melodies, harmonies, and acoustic instrumention to produce a dynamic ambient house record.</p>
