      <h1>Contact</h1>

      <p>I'm always happy to talk about my music, projects you're working on, licensing or commission opportunities, or anything else you would like to discuss.</p>

      <p>Please feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:levi@levipatel.com">levi@levipatel.com</a> or via social media.</p>

      <h2>Mailing List</h2>

      <p>My mailing list is the most direct way to hear from me, without any algorithms coming between us. I only use it a few times a year, but when I do it's usually for announcements and to discuss my projects in more depth than I do elsewhere.</p>

      <p>If you're interested, please enter your email address below and I'll keep you up to date.</p>
