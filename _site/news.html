  <h2>A Shifting Lightness - Album Release</h2>

  <p>I am so proud to share with you my album <i>A Shifting Lightness</i>, now available on <a href="https://smarturl.it/levipatel-asl">all digital platforms</a>.</p>

  <a href="https://smarturl.it/levipatel-asl" aria-label="A Shifting Lightness on Bandcamp"><img float="left" src="images/asl-1-artwork.jpg" width="60%" alt="A Shifting Lightness album cover artwork"></a>

  <p><i>A Shifting Lightness</i> is an exploration of lightness and memory, and my second full length album. From beginning the first demos in 2015, through spending 18 months living alone and writing the music, many months of recording and producing with almost 20 of the most talented people I know, and filming three music videos, it feels unreal that I’m finally releasing it today.</p>

  <p>Part of me feels bad for talking about my relatively insignificant album at a time when so many people are suffering, but I’ve also heard from some people that they are looking forward to the comfort of my new music. I really hope I can offer that in some small way.</p>

  <p>While the album is out on all platforms, if you are looking for the very best way to support me then the place to go is <a href="https://levipatel.bandcamp.com/album/a-shifting-lightness">Bandcamp</a>.</p>

  <p>Thanks to everyone who helped me make this album, thank you for all of your support, and I hope you enjoy the music! Take care <3</p>

  <h2>Words Like First Light - Single and Video</h2>

  <div class="videoWrapper">
    <iframe title="Words Like First Light music video" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/382518051?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff" width="1024" height="576" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
  </div>

  <p>I often hear musicians talk about how their best songs came naturally to them in minutes. I've also worked with many songwriters and composers who write at an unbelievably rapid pace. That gave me the expectation that my best work would come just as quickly, however my process has always been slow.p>

  <p>Words Like First Light began with an idea that took me two years to develop, through 12 major revisions and painstaking rearrangements. We then spent months recording the 12 incredible musicians who performed on the track and on the remaining production.</p>

  <p>After all of that, it took me by surprise that this piece has become one of the ones I love the most on A Shifting Lightness. I look forward to sharing the complete album with you on the 20th of March.</p>

  <p>Special thanks to Josh Allen, Jonathan Zsofi, and Julian Dyson for creating this video.</p>

  <p>You can now stream or download the music on <a href="https://smarturl.it/levipatel-wlfl">all digital platforms</a>.</p>

  <h2>Through Winter Eyes - Single and Video</h2>

  <p>Today I have released the first new track from my upcoming album - an intimate piano and cello duet named Through Winter Eyes.</p>

  <div class="videoWrapper">
    <iframe title="Through Winter Eyes music video" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/373814395?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff" width="1024" height="576" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
  </div>

  <p>I felt so much emotion while writing the piece but right up until recording I wasn't convinced that it should be on the album. The demo always sounded nice but never truly moved me. It turned out that it was missing a heartfelt cello performance in the hands of James Bush.</p>

  <p>James is a world renowned concert cellist known mostly for his baroque performances throughout Europe and New Zealand, and for founding a music school in Berlin offering tuition to children without the means to do so otherwise. He arrived at the recording studio with a carefully annotated score, detailing how he wanted to deliver each phrase in order to get the most out of the composition. Every take sounded incredible to me but he kept pushing and finding more and more emotional depth within the music, taking it far beyond what I thought would have been possible with the piece. From the moment I heard the first line until the end of the session I was captivated.</p>

  <p>Accompanying the release is a video by Jonathan Zsofi, Yonoko, Josh Allen, and their team. It's not often that I star in a video myself but it felt right to keep the visuals focused on the key aspects of this piece - the piano and cello performances. It also stars Sophie Faber, performing in place of James. The view you see in the video is of the same coastline I could see during the writing process.</p>

  <p>Through Winter Eyes is available now on <a href="https://smarturl.it/levipatel-twe">all digital platforms</a>.</p>

  <h2>A Shifting Lightness  - Coming Early 2020</h2>

  <p>Back in April I released A Shifting Lightness I, with parts 2 and 3 scheduled to be released throughout this year. Delays outside of my control led to a change of plan, but now it is almost ready.</p>

  <p>The music inspires me more than ever, and I cannot wait to share A Shifting Lightness with you early next year.</p>

  <h2>A Shifting Lightness I - Music Release</h2>

  <p>A Shifting Lightness I is the first instalment in a three-part series exploring themes of Lightness and Memory.</p>

  <a href="https://levipatel.bandcamp.com/album/a-shifting-lightness-i" aria-label="A Shifting Lightness I on Bandcamp"><img float="left" src="images/asl-1-artwork.jpg" width="60%" alt="A Shifting Lightness I album cover artwork"></a>

  <p>When writing the music, I was living alone for 18 months near a small town in the North of New Zealand. Every morning I would go downstairs into my half-underground recording space, and from where I was writing I could only see through a single window above ground.</p>

  <p>Spending so much time alone allowed me to take things slowly and to reflect on my past. It's strange what isolation can do to your thoughts, but it was rewarding to explore those aspects of myself through my music.</p>

  <p>A Shifting Lightness I is the first part of that exploration, available now on <a href="http://hyperurl.co/qs44zk">all digital platforms</a>.</p>

  <h2>Crossroads - Feature Documentary</h2>

  <p>Earlier this year I worked on my second documentary about the Sewol ferry disaster, this time a feature length called Crossroads. Crossroads explores the social and political movements that were catalysed by the disaster, interspersed with powerful monologues by survivors and their relatives.</p>
  
  <p>I was responsible for the soundtrack and sound design, with some of the music made in collaboration with Jesse Woolston.</p>

  <img float="left" src="images/crossroadsposter.jpg" width="60%" alt="Crossroads documentary poster">

  <p>Thanks to Neil and Han for bringing me onto the team and trusting me completely with the sound and music, to Jesse for his support with the soundtrack, and most of all to the people involved in the disaster for sharing their stories.</p>

  <h2>This Pale Fire - Alchemy (Album Production)</h2>

  <p>Before making instrumental music I began as a songwriter, so I was thrilled when This Pale Fire asked me to produce a song of his last year. One song turned into two, three, and eventually became his first full length album Alchemy.</p>
  <p>I couldn't be more proud of him for crafting such a beautiful and emotionally powerful collection of songs. It was a true pleasure to work on this album.</p>

  <p>Places like Leh are often represented internationally in a very limited way, so in this video we strove to create a more authentic insight into the region.

  <h2>Last Letters - Short Documentary</h2>

  <p>A journey through loss, space and memory. The film commemorates the victims of the tragic Sewol ferry accident, in which 304 out of 476 passengers and crew members died in 2014.</p>

  <p>On the 16th of April 2014 a ferry en route from Incheon to Jeju Island in Korea capsized. 304 out of 476 passengers and crew members died in this tragic accident. This short film follows eight families that lost loved ones that day, and explores the physical and emotional spaces that the tragedy left behind. The film juxtaposes documentary and fictional elements. It shines a light on this still unsolved tragedy and shows the isolation the families feel while they pose for an incomplete family portrait.</p>

  <p>I once again collaborated with filmmaker Nils Clauss to create this utterly heartbreaking and beautiful documentary.</p>

      <h2>5/8 - Collaborative EP with Suren Unka - Announcement</h2>

      <p>Suren Unka is an electronic music producer and an old friend of mine. We've been talking about making something together for years and <i>5/8</i> is the result of that.</p>

      <p>"Electronic meets modern classical composition on Auckland-based artists Suren Unka and Levi Patel’s debut collaborative EP 5/8, due out 5 August on Marigold Music.

      The unlikely allies effortlessly blend dance producer Suren’s swirling rhythms and electronic sound design with composer Levi’s slow moving harmonies and delicate textures to create a dynamic ambient house record.

      Residing at opposing ends of the musical spectrum, the two musicians manage to strike an intoxicating and unique balance between their home-base genres."</p>

  <p>"The territorial dispute between Japan and Korea over the ownership of Dokdo/Takeshima islets is one of the major stumbling blocks in bilateral relations. The dispute however is not limited to state to state relations as in both countries there are citizens' groups actively engaged in protesting, lobbying and educating the public. Who are these people however? What do they do in their everyday life? What motivates them to engage in this kind of activism? How do they see the other side? The usually sensational media coverage of their activities does not answer these questions. This documentary offers some answers by providing the individual activists on both sides with a platform to talk about themselves, their activism and their views of the other country and people."</p> 

  <p>Once again I worked with Nils Clauss, and this time also alongside Alexander Bukh. Alexander is a scholar of international relations of Northeast Asia. They are currently submitting the film to festivals and plan to release it on Vimeo next year.</p>

  <p>I would like to thank Glen Cleaver at BigPop Music for his crash course in film sound and for help when I needed it most.</p>

      <h2>A Strangely Isolated Place - Reflection on 2014 Mix</h2>

      <p>Ryan at A Strangely Isolated Place put together a beautiful and thoughtful end of year mix featuring the likes of A Winged Victory for the Sullen, Jon Hopkins, Otto A.Totland, Loscil, and he was kind enough to open the mix with <i>The Light Unbalances Her</i> from Forms.
      </p>

      <a href="https://astrangelyisolatedplace.com/2014/12/28/reflection-on-2014/"><img float="left" src="images/asipreflection2014.jpg" width="100%"></a>

      <p>"As with last year’s episode, the mix covers the genres we love here, including modern-classical, ambient, dub-techno, electronica and post-rock. So yes, be ready for twists and turns – unlike your more considered and conventional mix techniques."</p>

      <p>The mix can be streamed and downloaded for free at <a href="https://astrangelyisolatedplace.com/2014/12/28/reflection-on-2014/">astrangelyisolatedplace.com</a></p>

      <p>I only finished university last month but this makes me want to sign up for round two.</p>
