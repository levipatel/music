    <h1>Music Composer | Producer | Songwriter</h1>

    <p>Hello, my name is Levi Patel, and I love to create music here in New Zealand to share with you.</p>

    <p>I create beautiful music, typically by capturing delicate instrumental sounds and shaping them with ethereal electronics. Besides my own music, I produce and engineer for other artists, co-write songs, and compose music and sound for film and television. I'm also building a robot.</p>

    <p>Thank you for visiting, and I hope you'll enjoy what you find.</p>
