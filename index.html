  <h2>Music Composer | Producer | Engineer</h2>

  <p>Hello, my name is Levi Patel and I love to create music and share it with you.</p>

  <p>I love to create instrumental music that combines acoustic recordings with electronic manipulation. In addition to my own music, I produce and mix music for other artists, compose for film and television, and provide audio engineering and sound design for film and television. I'm also working on software (and maybe even a robot) to incorporate into my work.</p>

  <p>On this site you can find many examples of my work, and gain some insight into my inspiration and creative processes.</p>

  <p>Thank you for visiting and I hope you'll enjoy what you find.</p>

  <p><i>Last Letters</i> is a journey through loss, space, and memory. This short documentary commemorates the victims of the tragic Sewol ferry accident, in which 304 out of 476 passengers and crew members died in 2014.</p>
  <p>The film features music from my debut full-length album <i>Affinity</i>.</p>

    <h2>Of Sleep and Time</h2>
    <p>Before completing Affinity, I took some time away in a small coastal New Zealand town. I let go of my usual creative processes and created these three intimate pieces on an old, yet charming piano.</p>
