    <h1>Music Composer | Producer | Engineer</h1>

    <p>Hello, my name is Levi Patel and I love to create music here in New Zealand and share it with you.</p>

    <p>I create instrumental music that typically combines acoustic recordings with electronic manipulation. In addition to my own music, I compose for film and television, produce and engineer music for other artists, and design and mix sound for films. I'm also building a robot.</p>

    <p>Thank you for visiting and I hope you'll enjoy what you find.</p>
