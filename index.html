  <h2>Music Composer | Producer | Engineer</h2>

  <p>Hello, my name is Levi Patel and I love to create music and share it with you.</p>

  <p>I love to create instrumental music that combines acoustic recordings with electronic manipulation. In addition to my own music, I produce and mix music for other artists, compose for film and television, and provide audio engineering and sound design for film and television. I'm also working on software (and maybe even a robot) to incorporate into my work.</p>

  <p>On this site you can find many examples of my work, and gain some insight into my inspiration and creative processes.</p>

  <p>Thank you for visiting and I hope you'll enjoy what you find.</p>
