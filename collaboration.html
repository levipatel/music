      <h1>Production and Collaboration</h1>

      <p>When I think of the most rewarding musical experiences in my life, the best ones always come from working with other people.</p>

      <p>I produce music with other artists, co-write songs and instrumentals, record and mix music, and create my own reworks of other artists' tracks.</p>

      <!-- <p>Please feel free to get in touch if you might be interested in working together.</p> -->

      <p class="pad-top"><i>Alayna</i> is one of the most sensitive, beautiful songwriters I know. We wrote and produced <i>Cherry Tree</i> together with her long time collaborator Noema Te Hau III, and the day we wrote this was one of the most special in my life.</p>

      <p>Her entire album, <i>Self Portrait of a Woman Unravelling</i>, is absolutely stunning.</p>

      <p class="pad-top">Corban Koschak, aka <i>This Pale Fire</i>, aka one of my favourite songwriters, approached me looking to imbue some of my style into the production of his song <i>Northern Lights</i>. What began as one song turned into an opportunity to produce his beautiful album <i>Alchemy</i>.</p>

      <p class="pad-bottom">During the project Corban traveled up most weekends to my <a href="/studio">recording studio</a> north of Auckland, each time with the core of a new song. We would develop and arrange the songs together over each weekend, transforming them from solo acoustic songs into what you now hear on the album.</p>

      <h2>Toward the Sun - Collaboration with Rhian Sheehan</h2>

      </div>

      <p class="pad-top">Rhian Sheehan has been a huge influence on me since I discovered his music as a teenager, and recently we finally got to work together in a dream collaboration for me. We traded the spark of an idea back and forth until eventually it grew into <i>Toward the Sun</i>, released on Rhian’s album <a href="https://rhiansheehan.bandcamp.com/album/a-quiet-divide"><i>A Quiet Divide</i></a>.</p>

      <p>Every time I received a new version from him it was filled with beautifully subtle tweaks along with wonderfully surprising changes, and the music moved me more and more as the piece evolved. It was incredible.</p>

      <p>The music of Japanese composer <i>moshimoss</i> has captivated me from the moment I first heard it back in 2013. In our debut collaboration, <a href="/release/beneath-the-sky"><i>Beneath the Sky</i></a>, we exchanged and developed each other's simple piano phrases, expanding them to form soft melodies and delicate, beautiful soundscapes.</p>

      <p>Moshimoss - “It felt like creating the fictional history of a beautiful place.”</p>

      <p class="pad-top">No project has captured a chapter of my life more completely than <a href="https://galageorge.bandcamp.com/album/i-am-the-morning"><i>I Am The Morning</i></a>, the EP by <i>Gala George</i>. Beginning with a two week recording retreat to my <a href="/studio"> studio</a> north of Auckland, together we carefully crafted a collection of her beautiful songs exploring love and loss, grief, grounding, and growing comfortable in your own silence. We also wrote the final song together - <i>Love and Lost feat. Levi Patel</i>.</p>

      <p>I worked with electronic producer Suren Unka to create our <a href="https://surenunka.bandcamp.com/album/5-8"><i>5/8</i> EP</a>, and here we are performing it live in studio.</p>

      <p>While we both worked together on all elements, Suren focused on the beats and synth sound design, while I worked more closely on the melodies, harmonies, and acoustic instrumention to produce this dynamic ambient house record together.</p>

    <h2>Featured Reworks</h2>

    <p>When I approach a rework/remix project I typically ask myself what I would create if I had come up with the original parts, which always inspires me. It's also a special privilege to tear apart and rebuild someone's creation, so I always try to add my style while maintaining the essence of the original version.</p>

    <p>Here are recent examples of my reworks for three incredibly talented musicians.</p>
