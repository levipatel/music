   <p>With <a href="https://levipatel.bandcamp.com/music">four solo records</a> released to glowing reception, New Zealand’s Levi Patel is finding his standing as one of the country's most promising composers. The 28-year-old holds a passion for crafting musical pieces that delicately reflect an emotional intensity that is both gentle and captivating.</p>

  <p>Levi has a fascination with sound and the production process, which has encouraged him to pave his own compositional path. His passion for arrangement echoes throughout the diversity of his work. From intimate, solo piano to expansive and climactic soundscapes formed of layered voices and strings, Levi’s music has an encapsulating quality that speaks across his varied releases.</p>

  <p>With cathartic musical works, Levi's journey properly took flight in 2014 with his self-released EP <i>Forms</i>, which was closely followed by second EP <i>Of Sleep and Time</i>, the spiritual home to much-loved composition <i>As she passes</i> which has received well over 10 million streams across Soundcloud and Spotify worldwide.</p>

  <p>In recent years, Levi has composed for multiple international films including Nils Clauss’ <a href="https://youtu.be/Cg1zta6j34I">Last Letters</a>, a touching tribute to the victims of the Sewol ferry tragedy. He also co-wrote and featured on fellow kiwi composer Rhian Sheehan’s recent album, A Quiet Divide. Most recently Patel composed the soundtrack for short film <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9337716/">It’s Snowing Outside</a>, written and directed by Lucasfilm producer Rayne Roberts, and completed the work at Skywalker Ranch with a team supervised by André Fenley (Minority Report, Fight Club, Jurassic Park).</p>

<p>Since releasing pieces such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-iwfeSCsrc"><i>Since last letters</i></a> and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/levipatel/as-she-passes-1"><i>As she passes</i></a>, Levi has deservedly garnered attention from all ends of the globe.</p>
