One morning in September last year I opened my eyes , rolled over, and maintained my bad habit of checking my emails as soon as I woke up - 1 new message.

"My name is Rayne Roberts and I'm a director, producer, and executive at Lucasfilm... Oh, and I LOVE your music."

Rayne went on to describe how she had listened to my music while writing the script for an upcoming short film of hers, a passion project called _It's Snowing Outside_. She wanted to use a piece of my music in the film, and ideally have me compose the original soundtrack. Oh, and the film would be mixed at Skywalker Sound by a team supervised by Andr√© Fenley (Minority Report, Fight Club, Jurassic Park).

My first response was not joy or excitement. Instead, still only just waking up, I began testing if her email address was legitimate and cross referencing the information she gave me. Spam bots are getting more sophisticated after all. But yes, Rayne existed, and yes, she was a producer at Lucasfilm, and yes, her email looked legitimate. This was the real deal.

A few days later we talked over Skype, along with the short film's producer Mea Tefka. Not only were they real but they were incredibly friendly, and I could feel their inspiration. These were top-tier professionals who still had such a passion for their craft, and for making beautiful art and telling moving stories. Not only that, but they came to me with the perfect brief.

Often with film projects, by the time I get involved the pictures are already finished. That's fine, and is how many films are made, but it doesn't leave as much room for the music to influence the result. Rayne, however, came to me before filming had even begun. We had a chance to talk through the script, and discuss in depth what she was aiming to communicate with the story and delivery. By bringing me on so early, I had the chance to explore sounds and themes with plenty of time to develop them. It also meant that I could begin sharing my ideas early enough that the music could have some influence over the edit, helping their seamless cohesion.

The other wonderful part about the brief was that she gave me complete freedom to approach the music however I felt would be best. In my experience, that's how to get the best work out me, and many other artists. I admire and appreciate that she was willing to put so much trust into someone she had never met, all the way over in New Zealand.

I said yes (but you knew that) and over the next three months we developed the soundtrack. Next time, I'll tell you all about that process, as well as the best invitation I have ever received.
