preview: One morning in September last year I opened my eyes , rolled over, and maintained my bad habit of checking my emails as soon as I wake up - 1 new message.

"My name is Rayne Roberts and I'm a director, producer, and executive at Lucasfilm... Oh, and I LOVE your music."  
_- September 2018 (check the date, right align if possible)_

Rayne went on to describe how she had listened to my music while writing the script for an upcoming short film of hers, a passion project called _It's Snowing Outside_. She wanted to use a piece of my music in the film, and ideally have me compose the original soundtrack. Oh, and the film would be mixed at Skywalker Sound by a team supervised by Andr√© Fenley (Minority Report, Fight Club, Jurassic Park).

My first response was not joy or excitement. Instead, still only just waking up, I began investigating whether her email address looked legitimate, and cross referencing the information she gave me. But yes, Rayne existed, and yes, [she was the real deal](https://www.lucasfilm.com/news/spotlight-rayne-roberts/).

A few days later we talked over Skype, along with the short film's producer Mea Tefka - calling in from San Francisco and New York respectively. Not only were they real but they were incredibly friendly, and I could really feel their inspiration and enthusiasm. These were top-tier professionals who still had such a passion for their craft, for making beautiful art, and for telling moving stories. Not only that, but they came to me with the perfect brief.

Often with film projects, by the time I get involved the pictures are already finished. That's fine, and is how many great film soundtracks are made. Rayne, however, came to me before filming had even begun. That meant that we had plenty of time to talk through the script, and discuss in depth what she was aiming to communicate with the story and delivery. Bringing me on so early also gave me the opportunity to explore sounds and themes with lots of time to develop them, even the ideas that I wanted to try but weren't likely to succeed. It also meant that I could begin sharing my ideas early enough that the music could have some influence over the edit, helping the music and pictures develop together into a cohesive work.

The other wonderful part about the brief was that she wanted to give me complete freedom to approach the music however I felt would be best. In my experience, that's how to get the best work out of me, and many other artists. I admire and appreciate that she was willing to put so much trust into someone she had never met, all the way over in New Zealand.

It was a perfect brief from a kind, inspired, and experienced team.

I said yes (as you may have guessed by now) and over the following months we developed the soundtrack. Next time I'll discuss that process, and tell you about the best invitation I have ever received.
